# Auth Session Persistence & Metrics UI Fix

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Auth Session Not Persisting (Requiring Login on Every Reload)**

#### Problem
- User had to login every time the page was reloaded
- Session was not being restored from localStorage
- Guards were running before Firebase Auth fully initialized

#### Root Cause
The auth guards were checking authentication state immediately, but Firebase Auth needs time to:
1. Check localStorage for existing session
2. Validate the stored token
3. Restore the user session

The guards were making decisions before step 3 completed, causing false negatives.

#### Solution
✅ Updated both `authGuard` and `guestGuard` to be **async functions**
✅ Added `await authService.waitForAuthInit()` to ensure Firebase Auth completes initialization
✅ Guards now wait for actual auth state before making routing decisions

**Before:**
```typescript
export const authGuard: CanActivateFn = () => {
  return authService.user$.pipe(take(1), map(user => ...));
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const authGuard: CanActivateFn = async () => {
  const user = await authService.waitForAuthInit();
  // Now we have the actual auth state
};
```

#### How It Works Now
1. User logs in → Session stored in localStorage
2. User closes browser
3. User opens browser and navigates to app
4. Firebase Auth checks localStorage
5. Guards **wait** for Firebase to restore session
6. If session valid → User stays logged in ✅
7. If session invalid/expired → Redirect to login

### 2. **Metrics Fallback Messages Display Incorrectly**

#### Problem
Fallback messages like "Firefox N/A", "Not supported", "Check console" were being split across two lines with different font sizes, making them look broken:

```
Firefox    (huge font)
N/A        (huge font)
```

#### Solution
✅ Added conditional rendering logic in metrics.html
✅ Detects fallback/error messages
✅ Displays them as single-line, properly formatted text

**Logic:**
- If value is `Loading...`, `N/A`, or `Error` → Show as single line, medium size
- If value is `Firefox`, `Not`, `Check` → Show value + unit together, normal font
- Otherwise → Show as normal metric (large value, smaller unit)

#### Visual Improvements
**Before:**
```
Firefox    (size: 5xl)
N/A        (size: 2xl)
```

**After:**
```
Firefox N/A    (size: lg, single line, gray)
```

### 3. **FID Showing "Loading..." When It Should Say "Awaiting Input"**

#### Problem
- FID (First Input Delay) metric showed "Loading..." for 2 seconds
- Then changed to "Awaiting input"
- Confusing because it wasn't actually loading anything—just waiting for user interaction

#### Solution
✅ Changed default FID state from `Loading...` to `Awaiting input`
✅ Removed the 2-second timeout that was causing the state change
✅ Set `fidInputTarget` message immediately
✅ FID now clearly communicates it's waiting for user input from the start

**Before:**
```typescript
{
  title: 'FID',
  value: 'Loading...',  // ❌ Confusing
  unit: '',
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{
  title: 'FID',
  value: 'Awaiting',    // ✅ Clear
  unit: 'input',
}
```

## 📊 Updated Metrics Display Logic

### SSR Metrics (White Background)
- **TTFB, FCP**: Show numeric values with units
- **LCP**: Shows value OR "Firefox N/A" (single line)
- **CLS**: Shows value OR "Not supported" (single line)

### Hydration Metrics (Gradient Background)
- **TTI**: Show numeric values with units
- **TBT**: Shows value OR "Not supported" (single line)
- **Hydration**: Show numeric values
- **FID**: Shows "Awaiting input" (pulsing card) OR actual delay with input context

### Fallback Message Types
| Value | Unit | Display | Use Case |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| `Loading...` | `''` | Medium font, single line | Still gathering data |
| `N/A` | `''` | Medium font, single line | Metric not available |
| `Error` | `''` | Medium font, single line | Error occurred |
| `Firefox` | `N/A` | Gray text, single line | Browser not supported |
| `Not` | `supported` | Gray text, single line | API not available |
| `Check` | `console` | Gray text, single line | Check logs for details |
| `Awaiting` | `input` | Gradient text, pulsing | Waiting for user interaction |
| `[number]` | `ms/s` | Large value + small unit | Actual metric |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Session Persistence
```bash
1. Login to the app
2. Close browser completely
3. Open browser
4. Navigate to app
Expected: Should remain logged in ✅
```

### Test 2: Auth Guards
```bash
# Test authGuard
1. Logout
2. Try to access /dashboard
Expected: Redirect to /login ✅

# Test guestGuard
1. Login
2. Try to access /login
Expected: Redirect to /dashboard ✅
```

### Test 3: Metrics Display
```bash
# In Chrome/Edge
Expected: All metrics show numeric values ✅

# In Firefox
Expected: LCP, CLS, TBT show "Not supported" (single line, gray) ✅

# FID (all browsers)
Expected: Shows "Awaiting input" immediately (not "Loading...") ✅
After click: Shows actual delay with input context ✅
```

## 🔍 Console Logs to Look For

### Successful Session Restoration
```
🔐 AuthService: Auth state changed, user: [uid]
✅ AuthService: Auth initialized
🔐 Auth Guard: Waiting for auth initialization...
✅ Auth Guard: User authenticated, access granted [email]
```

### New Login Required
```
🔐 AuthService: Auth state changed, user: null
✅ AuthService: Auth initialized
🔐 Auth Guard: Waiting for auth initialization...
⛔ Auth Guard: User not authenticated, redirecting to login
```

### Metrics Collection
```
⏰ Metrics collection time: [timestamp]
🔍 Starting performance metrics collection...
✅ TTFB: [value] ms
✅ FCP: [value] s
⏳ FID: Awaiting user input
```

## 🎯 Key Changes

### auth.guard.ts
- ✅ Changed from synchronous to async
- ✅ Added `waitForAuthInit()` call
- ✅ Added detailed console logging
- ✅ Removed RxJS complexity for simpler async/await

### metrics.ts
- ✅ Changed FID default from "Loading..." to "Awaiting input"
- ✅ Removed unnecessary 2-second timeout
- ✅ Set `fidInputTarget` message immediately

### metrics.html
- ✅ Added conditional rendering for different metric states
- ✅ Separate display logic for normal values vs fallback messages
- ✅ Consistent styling for error/unsupported states
- ✅ Single-line display for compatibility messages

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Session Persistence**
   - ✅ No more re-login on page refresh
   - ✅ Session survives browser restart
   - ✅ Proper auth initialization before routing

2. **Better UX**
   - ✅ Clear, understandable fallback messages
   - ✅ FID clearly shows it's waiting for input
   - ✅ Consistent metric display across browsers

3. **Professional Appearance**
   - ✅ No broken UI for unsupported metrics
   - ✅ Proper text sizing and formatting
   - ✅ Browser compatibility messages are clear

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting logged out on reload
**Check:**
1. Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
2. Look for `firebaseLocalStorageDb` or similar
3. If missing, Firebase isn't storing the session

**Fix:**
- Clear browser cache and try logging in again
- Check browser console for Firebase errors
- Ensure `browserLocalPersistence` is being set

### Issue: Metrics show "Loading..." forever
**Check:**
- Open console and look for error messages
- Check if Performance API is available: `console.log(!!window.performance)`

**Fix:**
- Wait for timeouts (2-4 seconds)
- Refresh page if metrics don't update
- Check browser compatibility

### Issue: FID never updates after clicking
**Check:**
- Look for "📊 FID entry received" in console
- Verify you're clicking on the page (not DevTools)

**Fix:**
- Click anywhere on the metrics page
- Check if PerformanceObserver is supported
- Try different input types (click, keyboard)
